Please read the license terms below. If you do not agree to all of the terms and conditions of this License, then do not download, install, use, copy, or distribute Popmotion.

## Terms and Conditions

### Your Acceptance of this License Agreement

You should carefully read the following terms and conditions before using, installing, copying, or distributing Popmotion. Unless otherwise agreed in a writing signed by Popmotion, Ltd., your use, installation, copying, or distribution of Popmotion indicates your acceptance of this License Agreement.

The terms and conditions of this License Agreement describe the permitted use of each single installation (hereinafter, a “Licensed Copy”) of Popmotion.

### Scope of License

Subject to the terms of this License Agreement, Popmotion, Ltd. grants to you, for each Licensed Copy, a limited, non-exclusive, royalty-free, license to use, install, copy, or distribute Popmotion.

#### You may:
    
    - Modify, duplicate and distribute the source code for **non-commercial** uses.
    
#### You may not:

    - Sell, rent, lease or loan the source code, in whole or in part, nor permit anyone else to do so, unless such use is expressly **non-commercial**.

### License Agreement Model

This is a single-installation license, meaning you may integrate a Licensed Copy into one self-executable program distribution ("app" or "program"), software application, game, public-facing (“Internet”), internal (“intranet”) web root directory or a copy of a physical device at a time. You may also install and use Popmotion without limitation for local development and testing purposes.

### Licence Agreement Validity

In the event your intended use of Popmotion is a **commercial application**, as defined as follows; *a software application, website, web-based application, physical device or game that charges a one-time or recurring access or usage fee, or in which micro-transaction purchases are available*, a valid commercial license must be owned for that application. A commercial license covers multiple developers, but only one project/application.

### Commercial Licence Terms

    - You agree to pay to Popmotion Ltd, either $9 per month or $90 per year (excluding local sales tax).
    - Failure to reach payment within 30 days of invoice results in an invalidation of the commercial licence.
    - A commercial licence can be cancelled at any time by the licensee. This will invalidate the commercial licence immediately.
    - Refunds are available within 14 days of the commercial licence purchase date.

### Updates

Popmotion, Ltd will provide you with free updates to the edition of Popmotion for the remainder of Popmotion’s lifespan as long as a valid commercial license is owned. Such updates will include any updates for Popmotion that are released by Popmotion, Ltd for general distribution to Popmotion licensees. Popmotion, Ltd has no obligation to provide you with any updates that are not released for general distribution to Popmotion, Ltd’s other licensees. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to obligate Popmotion, Ltd to provide updates to you under any circumstances.

You may transfer your right to use the Licensed Copy to a third party, provided (a) that you transfer this License Agreement and the transferee accepts this License Agreement, (b) that you retain no copies of the Licensed Copy and its associated license key, and (c) that you notify Popmotion, Ltd about the transfer in writing or by email, providing the details of the new licensee. Such transfer involves the termination of the initial license granted to you under this License Agreement. After the transfer you will no longer have any right to use the Licensed Copy.
